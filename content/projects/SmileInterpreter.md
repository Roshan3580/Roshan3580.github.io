Built a modular interpreter for a BASIC-like programming language with full compatibility to the original Grin language specification. Engineered lexical analysis, streaming parsing, and runtime execution pipelines from scratch and implemented a custom token system, a robust global program state manager, and an extensible instruction set. Designed advanced error handling with detailed lexical, syntactic, and runtime diagnostics. Optimized for fast token processing and low-memory execution, the system supports future language extensions with ease due to its decoupled module structure.
