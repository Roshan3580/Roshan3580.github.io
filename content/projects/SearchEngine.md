Engineered a high-performance search engine prototype processing over 10,000 web documents, combining inverted indexing and graph-based ranking for efficient retrieval. Developed web crawling and indexing pipelines using Python, NLTK, and BeautifulSoup, achieving O(1) term lookups and eliminating 98% of duplicate pages via SHA-256 hashing. Integrated TF-IDF and PageRank algorithms to rank search results, reducing query response time to under 100 ms. Designed a scalable, modular system supporting future extensions like phrase queries and synonym-based expansion.
