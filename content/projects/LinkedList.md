Implemented clean, modular versions of both Singly and Doubly Linked Lists in C++, designed with extensibility and interface-driven architecture in mind. Defined a common abstract interface (`ILinkedList.hpp`) to support polymorphism and future data structure extensions. Developed core operations including insertion, deletion, and traversal with constant-time pointer manipulation. Enabled bidirectional navigation in the doubly linked list variant to support efficient two-way iteration.
