Developed an interactive, modular web crawler in Python capable of recursively extracting URLs and analyzing web content with user-defined parameters. Implemented real-time crawling with support for domain restriction, file-type filtering via regex, configurable crawl depth, and politeness delay. Used `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for robust HTTP handling and HTML parsing. Designed the CLI interface to prompt for crawl configuration, and optimized performance through selective traversal and deduplication. Output includes the longest page by word count and top 10 most frequent words, supporting lightweight text analytics at crawl time.
