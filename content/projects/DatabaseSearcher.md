Developed a modular desktop application for querying and editing structured geographical data using a custom event-driven architecture in Python. Implemented backend logic for SQLite data operations across continent, country, and region tables, supporting full CRUD functionality. Designed an interactive Tkinter GUI with dynamic views and custom dialogs, enabling seamless file-based database interaction. Engineered a scalable system architecture using decoupled event buses, MVC-style data models, and schema-driven validation to ensure flexibility and maintainability.
