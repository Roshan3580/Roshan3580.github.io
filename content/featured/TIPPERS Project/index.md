Built an IoT data visualization platform for real-time occupancy and energy monitoring at UCIâ€™s Donald Bren Hall. Improved sensor data processing speed by 40% using PL/pgSQL and JavaScript, and integrated Docker for scalable,
privacy-preserving deployments. Developed smart-space builder tools to model spatial contexts and privacy-utility tradeoffs.
