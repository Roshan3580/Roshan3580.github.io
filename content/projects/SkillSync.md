Built a full-stack platform that analyzes resumes, GitHub, and LinkedIn to generate personalized career paths, curated learning roadmaps, and GPT-powered mock interviews. Used NLP (spaCy, Transformers) for resume parsing, trained ML models for role prediction, and integrated LeetCode/GitHub APIs for a real-time skill dashboard. Deployed with React, Next.js, Node.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and OpenAI API; incorporated OAuth, Docker, CI/CD, and interactive data visualizations (Recharts).
